        for num in nums:

            # add num to seen_twice
            
            # third appearance: 
            # don't add to seen_once because of presence in seen_twice
            # remove num from seen_twice
            seen_once = ~seen_twice & (seen_once ^ num)
            seen_twice = ~seen_once & (seen_twice ^ num)

        return seen_once
