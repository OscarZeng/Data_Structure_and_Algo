######################Coding interview tips######################

In general: The whiteboard coding practice is to test basic coding and CS skills. Besides, communication skills also matters. Make sure I communicate with interviewer during the interview process.

Steps of the interview:
1. Figure out the question specification. DO NOT RUSH TO CODING without thinking through the question.
	a. Repharse the question and double check with the interviewer, make sure that I understand the question correctly
	b. Figure out the input format & Constraint. Is the input an array? Will there be negative numbers/Null values? 
	c. Clarify the output format of the return value.

2. Think out LOUD and think through the question before we actually write the code. 
	a. List out several potential solutions(Can start with naive solutions but start writing code only when you think the solution is optimal) while think out LOUD
	b. Constantly thinking out loud is the best way to ace an interview.
	c. Make sure the interviewer follows my idea so they can correct me when I went to the wrong direction

3. When writing the code, make sure that the interviewer will follow the step of my writing
	a. List out the strach first, Write proper comments
	b. Make sure we use the proper names for certain variables


4. Test the code in real time(Make sure to design proper test cases)

5. Try not to use tricks(For certain languages) unless we have to.
